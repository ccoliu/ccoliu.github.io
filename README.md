# About this project
    This is codoctopus a coding master can help you solve the problem whithout interactive.
    Simple is beautiful, ask and then go make a cup of coffee and wait for the results.
    No unnecessary interaction required.
    
    Looking for coding data sets to fine-tune our model.
