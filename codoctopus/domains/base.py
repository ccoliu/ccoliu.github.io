# Codoctopus — Domain interface
#
# A Domain is a pluggable set of conventions for one kind of task: what roles
# exist, which tools are available by default, how to nudge the planner, and
# how to check the final result actually worked. This is what replaces v1's
# Config.yaml, where CODE_MASTER / ANALYST / PRESENTER and the coding-only
# worksheet format were the only thing Codoctopus could ever produce.
#
# A Domain only ever touches the Planner and, after the fact, verify() — the
# Executor (codoctopus.runtime) never imports this module. PlanStep.role stays
# plain prompt text all the way through execution; a Domain's role *names*
# are resolved to that text inside make_plan(), before the Plan is returned.
# That's what keeps LocalExecutor (and the future CoworkifyExecutor) usable
# for any domain without either of them knowing domains exist.
#
# verify() takes a plain `dict[str, str]` of step results rather than a
# runtime.PlanResult on purpose: domains sit in core alongside planning and
# tools, and core must never import a runtime backend (codoctopus.runtime) —
# doing so here previously created an import cycle (planning -> domains ->
# runtime -> planning, since LocalExecutor itself needs Plan/validate_plan).
# Whoever calls an Executor and then wants to verify its PlanResult passes
# `result.step_results` through; that glue is the caller's job, not this
# module's.
